## About Me

I am a Lecturer at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, and a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Universiti Malaya. My research focuses on **Human-Centered AI** and **Human-AI Interaction**, with applications in education, mental health, and social computing.

I am particularly interested in understanding how AI transforms human learning, communication, and decision-making—and how we can design AI systems that genuinely serve human needs.

## Research Interests

My research develops **Human-Centered AI** to understand and improve how humans interact with AI systems. I focus on three interconnected areas:

**AI in Education.** How does AI reshape learning and teaching? I study cognitive scaffolding and offloading in AI-assisted programming, examining when AI helps students grow versus when it becomes a crutch. Our work in *International Journal of STEM Education* (Q1 Top) investigates AI's impact on motivation, anxiety, and collaborative learning.

**AI-Mediated Communication & Trust.** As AI increasingly mediates human communication, new challenges emerge around authenticity, trust, and memory. I explore how AI-assisted content creation affects perceived authorship, how AI-generated videos may induce false memories, and how users navigate privacy consent in AI-driven platforms.

**AI for Social Good.** I develop AI methods to support mental health communities (e.g., predicting response delays in online support forums) and ensure algorithmic fairness in recommender systems and urban computing (e.g., fair spatiotemporal traffic prediction).

Across these areas, I combine **empirical HCI methods** (experiments, surveys, qualitative studies) with **machine learning techniques** (graph neural networks, LLMs, conformal prediction) to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and human needs.
