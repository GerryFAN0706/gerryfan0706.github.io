## About Me

Welcome to my academic website!

I am currently a Lecturer at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, and a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Universiti Malaya. My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, and their applications in various domains including education, healthcare, and creative systems.

In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis and exploring new technologies.

## Research Interests

My research spans two interconnected areas of **Artificial Intelligence**: the **technical foundations** of intelligent systems and their **human-centered applications**.

**Graph Machine Learning & Algorithm Design**  
I develop advanced machine learning algorithms based on graph theory, focusing on:
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Designing efficient architectures for spatio-temporal prediction (traffic flow forecasting, healthcare analytics)
- **Graph Unlearning**: Developing methods for selective information removal in graph-structured data
- **Dynamic Graph Learning**: Capturing temporal evolution and key-node identification in large-scale networks

**Human-AI Interaction & Behavioral Computing**  
I investigate how people interact with, trust, and are influenced by AI systems across diverse contexts:
- **AI in Education & Creativity**: Understanding cognitive and emotional impacts of AI-assisted tools on learning, creative production, and collaborative work
- **Trust & Authenticity**: Examining how users perceive and respond to AI-generated content, from emotional prosody to text summaries
- **Healthcare Informatics**: Exploring human factors in clinical AI adoption and technology-mediated care

My work bridges computational modeling and empirical behavioral research, employing mixed-methods approaches to develop AI systems that are both technically robust and human-centered.
