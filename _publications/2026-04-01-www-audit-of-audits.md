**Conference:** The Web Conference (WWW) 2026 - Web4Good Track (CCF A)

**Location:** Dubai, UAE, April 13-17, 2026

**Keywords:** Web fairness, algorithmic auditing, Bayesian meta-evaluation, fairness claims, threshold alignment

**Abstract:** This paper presents a Bayesian meta-evaluation framework for auditing fairness claims on the web. Our approach yields interval-valued, threshold-aligned fairness assessments that provide more robust and interpretable fairness guarantees for web-based algorithmic systems.
