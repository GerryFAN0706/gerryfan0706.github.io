## Oral Presentation at IJCAI 2025

Presented research on "Creative Momentum Transfer: How Timing and Labeling of AI Suggestions Shape Iterative Human Ideation" at the IJCAI 2025 Satellite Event in Guangzhou, China.

**Conference:** International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025)  
**Event:** IJCAI 2025 Satellite Event  
**Location:** Guangzhou, China (广州)  
**Presentation Type:** Oral Presentation

### Research Highlights

- Investigated how the timing (early vs. late) and labeling (AI-labeled vs. unlabeled) of AI prompts shape multi-round human ideation
- Between-subjects experiment with 247 participants
- Demonstrated that early AI prompts increase overall creativity but induce stronger anchoring
- Late AI prompts trigger mid-round pivots that foster more divergent thinking
