Abstract
This study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Baidu's Ernie Bot, shape personal narratives when users seek emotional support over repeated sessions. Sixteen participants from China engaged in weekly chatbot interactions for four weeks, supplemented by reflective diaries and pre-/post-study interviews. Conversation analysis and quantitative measures (e.g., mood ratings, meaning-making scales) revealed incremental shifts in user language, including increased lexical alignment with AI-generated phrases and more positive emotion words. In-depth interviews highlighted the complex process by which participants alternately embraced or resisted the AI's framing, with many reporting newfound perspectives and a sense of empathic resonance. However, some voiced skepticism regarding the AI's genuine capacity for emotional understanding, underscoring ethical dilemmas related to anthropomorphism and data privacy. Overall, the findings suggest that iterative dialogues with an empathic-seeming LLM can facilitate meaningful narrative reframing, albeit with notable variations in user experience and potential risks of over-reliance.

Abstract
Emotional prosody---vocal cues that convey affect---profoundly influences how listeners interpret a speaker's intentions. We conducted two studies comparing AI- and human-generated emotional speech. In Study 1 (N=38), participants categorized five emotions (happy, sad, angry, neutral, fear) expressed by human voices and by an advanced text-to-speech (TTS) system. Human recordings exhibited higher overall accuracy (79.82% vs. 72.65%) and were rated significantly more natural, an effect partially explained by micro-perturbations (e.g., jitter, shimmer) that enhanced perceived authenticity. In Study 2 (N=53), these validated stimuli were incorporated into short scenarios, with each speaker labeled as either ``human'' or ``AI.'' Even when participants heard identical clips, those informed that the speaker was human exhibited greater trust and empathy, resulting in higher donation and advice-following rates. Although contemporary TTS systems effectively convey broad affective states, explicit AI labeling reduces perceived credibility and social engagement, underscoring the critical role that preexisting expectations play in human--AI communication.

Abstract
Document images often exhibit significant geometric distortions due to folds, curls, and non-ideal camera angles, compromising the readability and downstream text-processing performance. In this paper, we propose DocPINN, a novel single-image document dewarping framework that leverages Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve a second-order partial differential equation (PDE) controlling the warp. Unlike existing methods that directly regress a dense deformation field, DocPINN infers local PDE forcing terms from image features via a convolutional network, while enforcing boundary conditions and textline constraints in a globally consistent PINN solver. This setup ensures smoother transformations in severely warped regions without sacrificing local fidelity. We conduct experiments on the DocUNet benchmark and real scanned images, demonstrating that DocPINN achieves lower character error rates (CER) and improved structural similarity (MS-SSIM) compared to state-of-the-art methods like DewarpNet. Our ablation studies confirm that the combination of learned PDE forcing, text alignment, and boundary regularization is critical for effectively resolving both large-scale perspective distortions and intricate local folds.

# 4. Fan, G., Liu, D., Pan, L., & Huang, Y. Creative Momentum Transfer: How Timing and Labeling of AI Suggestions Shape Iterative Human Ideation. In *International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)*.

Abstract
Human–AI collaboration is increasingly integral to a variety of domains where creative ideation unfolds in iterative cycles, yet most existing studies evaluate AI-generated concepts in a single step. This paper addresses the gap by investigating “Creative Momentum Transfer”—how the timing (early vs. late) and labeling (AI-labeled vs. unlabeled) of AI prompts shape multi-round human ideation. In a between-subjects experiment (N= 247), participants proposed solutions for plastic pollution over two rounds, with AI suggestions introduced either at the outset or mid-process and labeled explicitly or not. Results reveal that early AI prompts increase overall creativity but induce stronger anchoring, whereas late AI prompts trigger a mid-round pivot that fosters more divergent thinking yet still boosts final outcomes compared to a no-AI control. Labeling amplifies both subjective and objective adoption of AI ideas, although most participants could detect AI sources even when unlabeled. Furthermore, qualitative interviews highlight nuanced perspectives on perceived ownership, authenticity, and the ways in which labeling triggers deeper scrutiny of the AI’s style. By demonstrating that baseline creativity moderates these effects more robustly than trust in AI, this study advances our theoretical understanding of multi-round human–AI synergy while offering design guidelines for nextgeneration creativity support systems. We discuss how user-centered design can balance rapid convergence (via early AI) with strategic pivot opportunities (via late AI) and weigh transparent labeling against ethical considerations of authorship and user autonomy.

# 5. Fan, G., Liu, D., Pan, L., & Huang, Y. Mapping Override Behavior Investigating Why and How Artists Reject AI Suggestions in Collaborative Creation. In *2025 international joint conference on neural networks (IJCNN)*. IEEE.

Abstract-Generative AI (GenAI) tools have rapidly transformed creative workflows by providing diverse visual outputs, yet a critical and understudied phenomenon involves the moment-to-moment decisions that artists make to accept or dismiss machine-generated suggestions. In this mixed-methods investigation, we focus on these subtle "override" behaviors within AIassisted illustration tasks. We recruited 57 digital artists (novice, intermediate, expert) and collected data from multiple sources: automated logs of override actions, concise in-task rationales, post-task surveys, and semi-structured interviews. Our findings indicate that stylistic discordance and technical flaws drive the highest number of rejections, though novices and experts differ markedly in both the frequency and speed of overriding. Regression analyses show that frequent dismissals strengthen perceptions of creative agency but do not consistently improve overall satisfaction; instead, the quality of final outputs emerges as the primary determinant of satisfaction. Interviews reveal how experienced artists swiftly discard suboptimal suggestions to maintain personal style, while novices oscillate between curiosity and fatigue. By mapping these decision points and their outcomes, we illuminate critical aspects of human-AI co-creation and propose design strategies-such as adaptive recommendation filtering and stage-aware interventions-to ease "override fatigue." Although this study centers on digital illustration, our approach and insights can extend to other creative or even scientific domains where iterative human-AI collaboration is essential.

ABSTRACT
Purpose: As mobile reading surges in China, platforms increasingly deploy AIgenerated summaries to mitigate information overload. This study examines, among Chinese mobile readers, how summary type (AI vs. human vs. none) shapes engagement (reading time, click-through), comprehension, and trust, and when skepticism toward AI translates into opening the full article.

Methodology: We conducted an explanatory, mixed-methods, within-subjects experiment ( $N=47$ ) in which adults in China read six Chinese-language news articles (technology, health, lifestyle) on their own smartphones under three conditions: AI summary + "Read Full", Human summary + "Read Full", and No summary (full text). We logged reading time, click-through, and scroll depth; administered five-item comprehension quizzes and trust/completeness scales after each article; analyzed outcomes using repeated-measures ANOVA, linear mixed-effects models, and logistic regression; and thematically analyzed open-ended responses.

Results: Human-written summaries received higher trust and perceived completeness than AI-generated summaries, yet click-through rates were comparable (AI: $81.9 \%$ vs. Human: $72.3 \%$ ). Providing the full text upfront yielded the highest comprehension; choosing to open the full article after viewing a summary largely eliminated the comprehension deficit. Topic relevance moderated the relationship between trust and click-through (lower trust increased opening only when relevance was high), and domain knowledge attenuated the comprehension penalty of summaryonly reading.

Conclusions: In on-the-go mobile contexts, an attitude-behavior gap emerges: readers who express low trust in AI summaries often still rely on them when perceived time costs of full-article reading are high.

Recommendations: For mobile HCI and news design, clearly label AI provenance with brief coverage disclaimers, offer adaptive/layered summaries that expand based on interest signals or in high-stakes domains, and provide strategic verification prompts that nudge readers to open the full article when depth and accuracy matter.

ABSTRACT
Accurate prediction of intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and improving patient outcomes. We propose ContrastLOS, a novel graph-based deep learning model that integrates graph transformer networks with contrastive pre-training to enhance ICU LOS prediction. By constructing dynamic patient similarity graphs, ContrastLOS captures intricate inter-patient relationships and temporal dependencies. Through contrastive learning on unlabeled data, the model develops robust patient embeddings suitable for both classification and regression tasks. Experiments on three comprehensive ICU datasets—MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV v3.0, and eICU—show that ContrastLOS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. For classification (predicting whether LOS exceeds 3 or 7 days), it achieves AUROC scores of up to 82.1%, improving performance by up to 5.2% compared to competitive methods. In regression tasks, ContrastLOS attains the lowest RMSE (2.41 days) and MAE (1.48 days) on the multi-center eICU dataset. Notably, it maintains an AUROC of 76.8% with only 10% labeled data, highlighting its effectiveness in low-resource settings. These findings suggest that ContrastLOS can serve as a robust clinical decision support tool for critical care management.


# 8. Yang, F., Liu, D., & Fan, G. (2025). Emotional labor and coping strategies of gynecological nurses in recurrent pregnancy loss care: a qualitative phenomenological study. *BMC nursing, 24*(1), 1-11.

Abstract
Background Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is marked by multiple pregnancy losses, placing intense emotional and clinical demands on gynecological nurses who often serve as both medical and emotional support for affected patients. While prior research on emotional labor in healthcare underscores the toll of caring for bereaved individuals, few studies have examined the unique, cyclical nature of grief inherent in RPL care.

Methods A qualitative, phenomenological design was employed to explore the experiences of 12 gynecological nurses working in early pregnancy units. Semi-structured interviews investigated nurses'perceptions of emotional labor, the coping strategies they utilized, and the influence of organizational factors on their well-being. Thematic analysis guided by Braun and Clarke's framework illuminated emerging patterns, with member checking and peer debriefing ensuring analytical rigor.

Results Four key themes emerged. First, The Emotional Burden of Recurrent Loss highlighted nurses' cumulative grief and sense of "compounding sorrow" as they supported patients through multiple losses. Second, Balancing Empathy and Professional Boundaries underscored the tension between offering genuine compassion and guarding personal emotional reserves. Third, Coping Strategies and Resilience-Building revealed a multilayered approach comprising reflective practices, peer debriefing, and self-care. Finally, Organizational Support and Gaps emphasized how institutional resources, staffing levels, and specialized training significantly shaped nurses' capacity to sustain empathetic care.

Conclusion Nurses caring for RPL patients experience heightened emotional labor due to repetitive, distressing encounters with loss. While individual and peer-based coping mechanisms foster resilience, organizational supportsuch as formal debriefing sessions and RPL-focused training-amplifies nurses' well-being and ensures sustainable, high-quality care. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions that address both the individual and systemic dimensions of emotional labor in RPL settings.

# 9. He, Y., Fan, G., Fan, G., & Liu, D. (2025). Exploring nurse and patient perspectives on WeChat-based prenatal education in Chinese public hospitals: a qualitative inquiry. *BMC nursing, 24*(1), 459.

Abstract
Background
With the increasing digitization of healthcare, WeChat has emerged as a popular platform for delivering prenatal education in China. While studies have shown its potential benefits, few investigations systematically explore how nurses implement WeChat-based prenatal education and how pregnant women engage with these interventions within public hospital settings. Understanding both provider and patient perspectives is critical for developing equitable, effective digital maternal care.

Methods
A qualitative exploratory design was employed in four public hospitals in Shanxi Province, China. Seventeen obstetric nurses and eight pregnant women participated in semi-structured interviews between March and August 2024. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis to identify commonalities and divergences between nurse-driven and patient-driven experiences.

Results
Nurses perceived WeChat as extending their professional reach beyond physical clinic hours and enhancing patient education, aligning with the Technology Acceptance Model constructs of perceived usefulness and ease of use. However, organizational constraints, digital training gaps, and blurred work–life boundaries posed challenges. Pregnant women similarly recognized WeChat’s convenience for quick clarifications and access to nurse-vetted information, yet wide variations in digital health literacy led to uneven engagement. Cultural factors, such as extended family involvement and preferences for in-person consultations, further influenced both nurse and patient usage patterns. Despite these challenges, participants converged on WeChat’s value as a complementary platform that could reduce clinic visits, offer immediate reassurance, and bolster continuity of care.

Conclusion
WeChat-based prenatal education holds significant promise for improving maternal health outcomes by facilitating frequent, real-time communication between nurses and expectant mothers. Nonetheless, the findings underscore the need for hospital-level policies, structured training programs, and culturally sensitive strategies to address privacy concerns, manage workloads, and reduce digital disparities. An integrated approach that combines nurse acceptance and patient digital literacy is essential to fully harness WeChat’s potential in public hospital contexts.

Implications
The study highlights practical steps for enhancing digital prenatal interventions, including standardized protocols for WeChat-based interactions, comprehensive nurse training in eHealth communication, and tailored support for pregnant women with limited digital skills. Such interventions can inform wider policymaking on telehealth and guide technology developers in creating user-friendly, secure digital platforms that optimize maternal care and reduce health inequities.

Abstract
This study examined the effects of power posing on presentation performance, academic self-efficacy, perceived stress, and confidence among 54 undergraduate students using a randomised controlled design. Participants either practiced power poses or reviewed notes before delivering a 5-minute presentation. Results showed that power posing significantly improved presentation performance (p = .047, d = 0.554). Within-group analyses revealed significant improvements in self-efficacy (p < .001, d = 0.739) and stress reduction (p = .003, d = –0.627) for the power posing group. Self-reported confidence partially mediated the relationship between power posing and presentation performance. A potential moderating effect of gender approached significance (p = .051). These findings contribute to embodied cognition literature in educational contexts and suggest that brief power posing interventions may enhance students’ presentation skills and confidence. Future research should explore long-term effects, individual differences, and applications in diverse academic settings to further understand power posing’s potential.

# 11. Zhao, R., Quan, Y. & Fan, G. Optimizing Operating Room Scheduling Through Multi-Level Learning and Column Generation: A Novel Hybrid Approach. *Health Care Manag Sci* (2025).

Abstract
Purpose: Operating room (OR) scheduling is a critical challenge in healthcare, directly impacting patient outcomes and hospital efficiency. Traditional methods often struggle with the complex, multi-level constraints and uncertainties inherent in OR scheduling, such as resource limitations, variable surgery durations, and emergency cases. This study aims to develop a novel hybrid framework that optimizes OR scheduling by integrating multi-level optimization with reinforcement learning and column generation techniques.

Methods: The proposed framework decomposes the OR scheduling problem into strategic, tactical, and operational levels, enabling focused optimization at each layer while ensuring cohesive decision-making acroes the hierarchy. Reinforcement learning guides the column generation process, learning policies that identify promising scheduling options to enhance solution quality and computational efficiency. Robust uncertainty handling mechanisms are incorporated to manage variability in surgery durations and resource availability without compromising tractability. Experiments were conducted using three years of real-world data from Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital, complemented by large-scale synthetic datasets to evaluate scalability and robustness of the framework.

Results: The framework demonstrates meaningful improvements in key operational metrics compared to traditional approaches. Analysis of three years of implementation shows consistent enhancements in operational efficiency, including a reduction in average patient waiting time by $15.8 \%$ (from 10.1 to 8.5 days), an increase in OR utilization by 5.4 percentage points (from $73.8 \%$ to $79.2 \%$ ), and improved workload balance among surgeons. The framework maintains robust performance under uncertainty, achieving a $92.5 \%$ feasibility rate and reducing schedule disruptions by $26.2 \%$.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework offers a practical and scalable solution for optimizing OR scheduling, demonstrating improvements in healthcare delivery and operational performance in real hospital environments. By effectively balancing multiple operational objectives while handling practical constraints and uncertainties, the framework provides a viable approach for healthcare systems seeking incremental yet sustainable improvements in efficiency and patient care.

# 12. Liu, D., & Fan, G. (2025). Digital duality: negotiating tradition, modernity, and identity among rural housewife Douyin creators in China. *Information, Communication & Society*, 1-18.

Abstract
Douyin, the Chinese domestic version of TikTok, has rapidly become a key social media platform in rural China, offering new avenues for self-expression and economic participation. This study draws on in-depth interviews with 21 rural housewife Douyin creators to investigate how they balance traditional household responsibilities with evolving digital identities. The findings indicate that Douyin opens up unprecedented opportunities for these women to challenge stereotypes, showcase agricultural and domestic skills, and redefine rural femininity. However, this engagement also introduces constraints, including algorithmic pressures to curate content, community scrutiny, and the need to reconcile online visibility with cultural expectations of modesty. Despite these challenges, many participants use Douyin’s interactive features to negotiate complex family and community dynamics, thereby shaping new perceptions of rural womanhood. By examining the interplay between tradition and modernity, the study highlights how Douyin serves as both a platform for empowerment and a space where existing gender norms can be reinforced. The analysis shows the intricate ways in which digital media can transform social roles, while also drawing attention to the persistent cultural and structural barriers that rural housewife creators face. Overall, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the multifaceted impact of short-video platforms on rural women’s identities, family relations, and community engagement in contemporary China.

Abstract
Accurate traffic flow prediction is crucial for effective management of urban transportation but remains challenging due to rapidly changing network conditions. We introduce a dynamic key-node multi-graph neural network (DynaKey-GNN) that identifies both long-term vital nodes and short-term critical nodes, enabling real-time adaptation to traffic shifts. An incremental update strategy selectively processes network changes, boosting computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. We also propose a dual-stream architecture that fuses global patterns with targeted key-node processing, capturing both stable and fast-evolving dependencies. Experiments on four real-world traffic datasets show that our approach achieves up to 12.37% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines under dynamic scenarios. Case studies on volatile nodes further confirm the model’s ability to handle abrupt fluctuations in traffic flow, providing consistent and reliable forecasts.

(2) We systematically organize and summarize different graph construction methods, feature selection and fusion techniques, and various structural designs in GNN-based traffic prediction. This includes a comprehensive examination of static, adaptive, and dynamic graph constructions, multi-view and hypergraph approaches, as well as emerging trends such as physics-informed GNNs and hybrid architectures. (3) We offer a critical analysis of real-world implementation challenges, including scalability, computational efficiency, and strategies for handling data quality issues, alongside identifying promising future research directions. By providing this comprehensive, quantitative evaluation alongside a thorough review of recent advancements, our survey offers researchers and practitioners a clear understanding of the current state-of-the-art in GNN-based traffic prediction.

# 15. Fan, G., Liu, D., Zhang, R., & Pan, L. (2025). The impact of AI-assisted pair programming on student motivation, programming anxiety, collaborative learning, and programming performance: a comparative study with traditional pair programming and individual approaches. *International Journal of STEM Education, 12*(1), 16.

Abstract
Purpose
This study investigates the impact of AI-assisted pair programming on undergraduate students’ intrinsic motivation, programming anxiety, and performance, relative to both human–human pair programming and individual programming approaches.

Methods
A quasi-experimental design was conducted over two academic years (2023–2024) with 234 undergraduate students in a Java web application development course. Intact class sections were randomly assigned to AI-assisted pair programming (using GPT-3.5 Turbo in 2023 and Claude 3 Opus in 2024), human–human pair programming, or individual programming conditions. Data on intrinsic motivation, programming anxiety, collaborative perceptions, and programming performance were collected at three time points using validated instruments.

Results
Compared to individual programming, AI-assisted pair programming significantly increased intrinsic motivation (p < .001, d = 0.35) and reduced programming anxiety (p < .001), producing outcomes comparable to human–human pair programming. AI-assisted groups also outperformed both individual and human–human groups in programming tasks (p < .001). However, human–human pair programming fostered the highest perceptions of collaboration and social presence, surpassing both AI-assisted and individual conditions (p < .001). Mediation analysis revealed that perceived usefulness of the AI assistant significantly mediated the relationship between the programming approach and student outcomes, highlighting the importance of positive perceptions in leveraging AI tools for educational benefits. No significant differences emerged between the two AI models employed, indicating that both GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 3 Opus provided similar benefits.

Conclusion
While AI-assisted pair programming enhances motivation, reduces anxiety, and improves performance, it does not fully match the collaborative depth and social presence achieved through human–human pairing. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of AI and human interaction: AI support can bolster learning outcomes, yet human partners offer richer social engagement. As AI capabilities advance, educators should integrate such tools thoughtfully, ensuring that technology complements rather than replaces the interpersonal dynamics and skill development central to effective programming education.
